todo for this project
1) separate concerns (html/css/js into individual files)
2) clean up the styling for an more appealing design
3) clean up javascript: better naming conventions, remove any repetitiveness, etc.
4) test game features: ensure buttons work, data is displayed, and scores are calculated.
5) add scores: rate the user on the enclosures they put the animals in.

Game rules
- must place all animals inside enclosures
- should place the animals in the best enclosure for them:
    note:
        determine the best enclosure for each animal (1 good = 3pt, 1 okay = 2pt, anything else bad = 1pt)
        calculate total possible points (3 * total animals)
        calculate user score (add all points / total points)
        display points at find screen
